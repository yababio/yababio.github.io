Hi, thanks for stopping by!

My name is Yaa and I am a 2nd-year MPH [Epidemiology](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/epidemiology) and [Applied Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/degrees/master-public-health/certificates/applied-biostatistics) student at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/). I'm passionate about health equity and improving health outcomes on a global scale. My current research interests include infectious disease epidemiology (HIV and neglected tropical diseases), as well as substance abuse epidemiology. 


In my spare time, I enjoy thrifting, exploring new museum exhibits, and trying different restaurants in the city.
